bio: Yannick Lingelbach loves nothing more than the thrill of a challenging climb and the satisfaction of a successful ascent. I live for the views from the top, the fresh air of the high altitude, and the satisfaction of a hard-earned achievement. When I'm not scaling the heights, I'm singing my way around via ferratas, and I never miss an opportunity to try a new one. Come join me on my next adventure and let's conquer the world together!
