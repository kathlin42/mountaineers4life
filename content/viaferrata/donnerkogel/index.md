summary: A great via ferrata classic on the west side of the Dachstein - highlight is a 40-meter giant ladder on which you cross a deep gorge. In four very different stages, you climb the Intersport via ferrata on the Gro√üer Donnerkogel. This iron route is one of the most controversial via ferrata projects in Austria. Overall, you get an appealing - and when using the giant ladder on a hugely exposed - via ferrata adventure with fantastic Dachstein views.
